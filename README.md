# 20090103

welcome to [20090103](https://brainzhang-bitcoin.github.io/20090103/)

The Times 03/Jan/2009 is birthday of bitcoin. It's the timestamp of genesis block.

I create this site just for fun, and weâ€™re building a contemporaneous and historical record that is unparalleled in bitcoin history. There are all sorts of interesting possibilities.
